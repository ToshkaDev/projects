Most every web application / API will need its communications to be secured via
SSL.

Reference: https://knowledge.rapidssl.com/support/ssl-certificate-support/index?page=content&actp=CROSSLINK&id=SO17540

* Order a SSL certificate from your vendor of choice (e.g. cheapsslsecurity.com)
* Generate a CSR (certificate signing request)
  - From existing key:

    $ openssl req -new -key releto.privatekey.pem -out releto.csr

    Note: Include www. for the FQDN as this may be used for both the domains wih
      and without the www.

* Upload the CSR to the SSL cert store
* They will mail out the certificate
* Concatenate the primary and intermediate certificates
* Install in nginx
* Restart nginx

## SSL Security
Use (SSL Labs)[https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/] to test if the SSL is secure.
